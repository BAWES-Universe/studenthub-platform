// the writer builds from and the reviewer holds the result to. All of it is
// pinned in reviewed code. config.json may name a card lane but never widen
// it (workspace-scope.mjs), and Linear text never reaches a prompt.

const SHU197_BRIEF = `Card SHU-197 (slice X1 of SHU-192): typed platform configuration and an integration register.

Goal. Deployment preflight validates a typed, closed configuration schema at startup, and the repository carries a checked-in register of every third-party integration the legacy StudentHub app used, with its owner, the names (never values) of its credentials, its rotation state and its cutover disposition. The register describes integrations; nothing connects to any of them.

1. Typed configuration, in deploy/coolify/preflight.mjs.
- The production image copies only preflight.mjs into deploy/coolify/, so keep the schema inside that file and import nothing but node: builtins.
- Export CONFIG_SCHEMA: one frozen entry per variable preflight reads, with name, required (boolean), kind ("url", "url-list", "host-list", "string" or "literal") and secret (boolean). Required, in this order: DATABASE_URL, OIDC_ISSUER, OIDC_CLIENT_ID, OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET, OIDC_CALLBACK_URL, OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_URL, OIDC_TOKEN_URL, OIDC_JWKS_URL, LOGIN_ALLOWED_RETURN_URLS. Also declared, as today: HOST (literal 0.0.0.0) and PLATFORM_DATABASE_HOSTS (optional). DATABASE_URL and OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET are secret.
- REQUIRED_DEPLOYMENT_ENV stays exported with exactly the nine names above in that order, derived from CONFIG_SCHEMA. deploy/coolify/deployment-env-manifest.mjs and deploy/coolify/test/deployment.test.mjs (both outside your scope) depend on it and on every current error message, which must not change.
- Closed schema: a variable whose name starts with OIDC_ or LOGIN_ and that CONFIG_SCHEMA does not declare fails validateDeploymentEnv with "unknown configuration variable <NAME>".
- Every error names the variable and never contains a value.

2. The register.
- deploy/coolify/integration-register.json: { "schemaVersion": 1, "integrations": [...] } with exactly the 27 rows below, in order. Each entry: id, name, owner (the first owner card), owner_cards (all of them), credential_names (array of names; empty for "(none)", where the integration needs no secret, and for "(unrecorded)", where the inventory did not record the names, which notes must then say), rotation_state, disposition, notes (one short sentence of your own, no values, no URLs).
- rotation_state is one of rotate-revoke, operator-check, db-state-unknown, none. disposition is one of keep, replace, drop, pending. "pending" means the owner has not decided; it blocks retiring the legacy service (SHU-122) and connecting the integration.
- deploy/coolify/integration-register.mjs exports validateRegister(register) returning { ok, errors }, where each error names the entry id and field. It refuses a missing or empty field, an unknown enum value, a duplicate id, and any string that looks like a secret value or a location: a URL, an email address, an IP address, or a run of 20 or more letters and digits that has both a letter and a digit.
- docs/integrations.md: a short plain-language page with one table row per entry (id, integration, owner, rotation state, disposition), saying the JSON file is the source of truth.

Rows (id | integration | credential names | rotation state | disposition | owner cards):
${SHU197_REGISTER}

3. Tests, with node:test and node:assert only, importing only files in your scope and node: builtins (no dist/, no packages).
- deploy/coolify/test/config-schema.test.mjs: start from a complete valid environment written out in the test; for each of the nine required names, written out literally in the test (never read back from CONFIG_SCHEMA or REQUIRED_DEPLOYMENT_ENV, or the mutation would pass), deleting it fails with its name; an undeclared OIDC_ variable fails with its name; a secret value given in each secret variable never appears in any error message.
- deploy/coolify/test/integration-register.test.mjs: the committed register validates; for every entry, removing owner fails validation and names that entry; the 27 ids and each row's rotation state and disposition match the table above, written out in the test; the register file contains no value-like string; docs/integrations.md lists every id.

Out of scope: the Dockerfile, the env manifest, deployment.test.mjs, any network call or credential, any change outside the paths you are given.`;
